# FindMyHoney
Programming assignment for the assessment at NHTV.

Instructions:
This is a reaction game. You have to find your honey and grab her fast before
the thugs get her! Alas, she keeps running away... (why are you chasing her?
It's obvious she doesn't like you anymore... You gotta learn to let go).

Click the female character as fast as possible for a high-score.
Click a thug and you get beat up!
If you get beaten up thrice, you get the message and stop following
your honey (you're better off without her anyway, look at her,
chasing thugs...).
Be warned! The pace of the game speeds up the longer you play!

At any time while playing, press ESC to *quit* and go back to main menu.

Almost forgot! Click to get past the splash screen.
